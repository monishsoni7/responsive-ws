        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions affect many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies. They determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend. International organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children.
          
          Many factors influence whether education is successful. Psychological factors include motivation, intelligence, and personality. Social factors, like socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender, are often linked to discrimination. Further factors include educational technology, teacher quality, and parent involvement.

      <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
        
        We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…

      <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Fresh Little Minds ‘Lets GROW Together’ programme is a targeted early intervention programme tier 2–3 intervention for carers/parents and child/ren to undertake together.
        This intervention has been successful in supporting and deescalating the stresses experienced by many families on waiting lists for CAMHS & ASD services.  Parents/carers are empowered to become proactive in supporting their own children’s emotional wellbeing and coping strategies. Results have included a reduction in overwhelm, more empowered parents, and a clinical prediction for reduced risk for mental disorders including depression, anxiety, concentration disorder and ASD.
        This initiative aims to improve the health and wellbeing of parents & children through nurturing resilience.</p>
